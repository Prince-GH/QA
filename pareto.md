## Pareto Analysis

Pareto Analysis is used to identify the most significant tasks or problems. It operates on the **80/20 rule**, where 80% of results are derived from 20% of causes.

### Features of Pareto Analysis
- **Focus on the vital few**: Identify and prioritize key tasks or issues.
- **Visualization with a Pareto chart**: Create a graphical representation to highlight critical areas.

### Steps to Perform Pareto Analysis
1. **Identify the problem**: Clearly define the issue to be addressed.
2. **Find the cause of the problem**: List the contributing factors.
3. **Measure and categorize**: Quantify and group the causes.
4. **Visualize the data**: Use a Pareto chart to represent the data.
5. **Analyze the result**: Identify the key contributors to the problem.
6. **Focus and act**: Address the top causes for maximum impact.

### Example
- **40%** of delays are caused by machine issues.
- **30%** of delays are caused by labor shortages.
- **10%** of delays are caused by poor inventory management.

By addressing the top two causes (40% + 30%), **70% of delays** can be resolved.

### Applications of Pareto Analysis
- **Business and Quality Control**: Improve efficiency and reduce defects.
- **Time Management**: Focus on tasks that provide the highest value.
- **Project Management**: Allocate resources to critical areas.
- **Customer Service**: Address the most frequent complaints to enhance satisfaction.

### Pro Tip
Use graphs or Pareto charts to better visualize and present your findings for maximum clarity and engagement. üòäüòÅ
